            <h2>Project Rebirth: Restoring Gaming Gems, One Title at a Time</h2>
            <p>Project Rebirth, created by ZKWolf in 2022, began as a personal project to revive Deathgarden:
              Bloodharvest. Initially, it was an attempt to make a once-unplayable game accessible again. Surprisingly,
              ZKWolf's efforts worked, successfully reverse-engineering the game and rekindling interest among
              players.</p>
            <p>While Project Rebirth is still in its early stages, its success with Deathgarden: Bloodharvest has
              sparked excitement and potential for more. As the project gains traction, it aims to explore other
              forgotten games, breathing new life into them one at a time.</p>

          <p>Project Rebirth is currently focused on finishing the revival of Deathgarden: Bloodharvest.</p>
          <p>Project Rebirth is also actively working on developing a dedicated launcher that will be available for
            download directly from the website once completed. This launcher will serve as a central hub for accessing
            revived games, including Deathgarden: Bloodharvest and other titles. It aims to streamline the gaming
            experience for users, providing easy access to these games.</p>
          <p>Once we finish the launcher, we will also open requests for other games to be added to this launcher that
            have not been revived by us.</p>
          <p>If you have any questions, feel free to contact us!</p>
