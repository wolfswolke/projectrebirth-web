              <h2>Project Rebirth: Restoring Gaming Gems, One Title at a Time</h2>
              <p>Project Rebirth, created by ZKWolf in 2022, began as a personal project to revive Deathgarden: Bloodharvest. Initially, it was a attempt to make a once-unplayable game accessible again. Surprisingly, ZKWolf's efforts worked, successfully reverse-engineering the game and rekindling interest among players.</p>
              <p>While Project Rebirth is still in its early stages, its success with Deathgarden: Bloodharvest has sparked excitement and potential for more. As the project gains traction, it aims to explore other forgotten/killed games, breathing new life into them one at a time.</p>

          <p>Project Rebirth is currently focused on finishing the reviving of Deathgarden: Bloodharvest.</p>
          <p>Project Rebirth is also actively working on developing a dedicated launcher that will be available for download directly from the website once completed. This launcher will serve as a central hub for accessing revived games, including Deathgarden: Bloodharvest and other titles. It aims to streamline the gaming experience for users, providing easy access to these games. Stay tuned for updates on our projects and the launcher's progress on this website!</p>
          <p>Once we finished the launcher we will also open requests for other games to be added to this launcher that have not been revived by us.</p>
          <p>If you have any Questions feel free to contact us!</p>
